## Music Attribution

Place music files (`.mp3`, `.wav`, or `.ogg` format) in this directory. The splash screen will randomly select and play one of these tracks.

Each music file should be named descriptively with artist attribution, for example:
- `epic_battle_by_artist.mp3`
- `cyber_war_by_composer.ogg`

The filename (without extension) will be displayed in the bottom right corner of the splash screen.
